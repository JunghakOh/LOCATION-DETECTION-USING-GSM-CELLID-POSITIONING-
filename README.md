# LOCATION-DETECTION-USING-GSM-CELLID-POSITIONING-
The objective of the project is to find the accuracy in  detection of the geographical coordinates with the given GSM CellId. We will also find out the continuous inference of a list of familiar places in a personal symbolic referential for the user. Here, a personal symbolic referential is defined as a list of places that have already been visited by the user, and that can be used to characterize his/her context. The proposed approach is based on detecting time periods in which the user is not moving or is moving slowly within a restricted area, and on identifying and clustering the coordinates corresponding to the GSM cells serving the corresponding area.
